# Get Credit score from EndPoint



## Frameworks used



### AlamoFire

AlamoFire was chosen to be used since it's based on URLSessions but also allows you to write networking code much easier. 
The written code is also much cleaner and easier to read.


### Charts

Charts was chosen to display the information as required. 
Charts has a built in Pie Chart which was used to display teh Credit score. It is relatively easy to use and since I've had previous experience using Charts, I decided to go with this option.

### SwiftyJSON

SwiftyJSON was used to handle JSON objects easier in Swift.
